A shooting gallery game for iOS implemented with Swift and UIKit.

In this case, the targets are fish and you need to touch them in order to gain points. Slower fish will award you fewer points while faster fish will award you more. If you touch a dead fish, you will lose points. When you cannot make any fish 'pop' anymore, you need to click on the plus button at the top to 'recharge'.

The game also includes a few nice sound effects.
